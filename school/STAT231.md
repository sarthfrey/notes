## Day 1

- An _empirical study_ is one where knowledge is gained by observation or experiment

- Empirical studies deal with _populations_ and _processes_ which are groups of individual _units_

- A population is a collection of units

- A process is a system by which units are produced, typically over time

- _Variates_ are characteristics of units which define what the measurement of the unit looks like

- Terms we use to describe variates:

  - Continuous, ex. reals
  - Discrete, ex. integers
  - Categorical, ex. circle, square, triangle
  - Ordinal, ex. small, medium, large
  - Complex, ex. unstructured text


## Day 2

* A *sample survey* is where information is obtained about a finite population
* An *observational study* is where information about the population is conducted without interfering with the observed phenomena
* In contrast, an *experimental study* is where we change something with the phenomena
* A sample survey still "interferes" by directly querying data from the units of the population
* An observtional study often involves the data being collected over time, whereas a sample survey often only has one point of contact
* Don't always jump to graphical summaries! 

**Types of numeric measures**

Measures of location:

- Median
- Mean
- Mode

Measures of variability:

- Sample variance
- Sample standard deviation
- Quantiles
- Interquartile range (distance between 1st and 3rd quartile)
