## Day 1

- An _empirical study_ is one where knowledge is gained by observation or experiment

- Empirical studies deal with _populations_ and _processes_ which are groups of individual _units_

- A population is a collection of units

- A process is a system by which units are produced, typically over time

- _Variates_ are characteristics of units which define what the measurement of the unit looks like

- Terms we use to describe variates:

  - Continuous, ex. reals
  - Discrete, ex. integers
  - Categorical, ex. circle, square, triangle
  - Ordinal, ex. small, medium, large
  - Complex, ex. unstructured text
