## Day 1

#### Basic Review

Conditional probability:
$$
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} \\
    P(A \cap B) = P(A|B)P(B)
$$
Law of total probability:
$$
P(A) = \sum_{i=1}^{n}P(A|B_i)P(B_i)
$$
Baye's Rule:
$$
P(B|A) = \frac{P(A|B)P(B)}{P(A)}
$$
**Example 1.2**

> Show that when $n$ is large and  $p$ is small, the $BIN(n, p)$ distribution may be approximated by a $POI(\lambda)$ distribution where $\lambda =np $.
